# **Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IPCAS) – Time Perception and Estimation Sample**
This dataset was collected at the **Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IPCAS)** in Beijing, China, as part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)**. It includes resting-state fMRI, anatomical MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 30 participants who underwent two scan sessions one week apart. The study was designed to investigate neural mechanisms of **time perception and estimation**, providing a valuable longitudinal dataset for assessing test–retest reliability of multimodal MRI measures.

Participants were instructed to rest while maintaining visual fixation on a central cross throughout the resting-state scans. Each subject completed **two sessions spaced one week apart**, allowing analysis of short-term reliability in brain structure and function.
