### **License and Data Privacy**

This dataset is part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)** initiative, which promotes open data sharing to advance the study of brain function and connectivity.

> *The CoRR Project data sharing effort provides the research community with open access to datasets contributed by labs from around the world. All datasets in the CoRR repository are entirely anonymized in compliance with HIPAA protocols. This includes the removal of personal identifiers from headers and support files, as well as defacing of structural images. Each participant is assigned a randomized seven-digit ID. Upon receipt by CoRR staff, headers are further processed to ensure no identifying information remains. All phenotypic data are reviewed to remove personally identifying variables. For clinical datasets, categorical diagnoses and severity measures (if available) are provided, along with any physiological data that does not compromise privacy. Datasets are included in the repository only after written permission is granted by contributing investigators, allowing unrestricted public use without limitations.*

### **Sample Overview**

The MRN Repeat Resting-State Sample includes **112 scans from 56 healthy participants**, each completing **two sessions spaced four months apart**. Each subject has:

* 2 anatomical scans
* 2 resting-state fMRI scans
* 2 DTI scans

During the resting-state scans, participants were instructed to remain still with eyes open and focus on a central fixation cross. The verbal instruction was:

> *“We are about to begin the rest task. For this task you will be asked to lie still and keep your eyes focused on the crosshairs while the machine is on. Do you have any questions?”*

Note: **Not all subjects have complete test-retest data**.
