# **Mind Research Network (MRN) Repeat Resting Sample**
This dataset was collected at the **Mind Research Network (MRN), Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA**, to examine the test–retest reliability of resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI over a four-month interval. It includes repeated scans from healthy adults and provides a valuable benchmark for assessing stability of intrinsic connectivity and structural measures across sessions.

The study recruited **56 healthy participants**, each undergoing **two scan sessions** approximately four months apart. For each subject, two **anatomical scans**, two **resting-state fMRI scans**, and two **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)** datasets are available.  
During resting-state scans, participants were instructed to **keep their eyes open** and fixate on a crosshair while remaining still. The verbal instruction was:  
> “We are about to begin the rest task. For this task you will be asked to lie still and keep your eyes focused on the crosshairs while the machine is on. Do you have any questions?”  

This dataset supports studies on **intra-individual variability**, **test–retest reproducibility**, and **methodological effects** in resting-state network analysis and diffusion imaging.
