# **Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Test–Retest Multiband fMRI and DTI Dataset**
This dataset was collected at the **Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (Orangeburg, NY, USA)** to evaluate the test–retest reliability of multiband resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). It served as the pilot foundation for the later *Enhanced NKI–Rockland Sample (NKI–RS)* project. Participants underwent multiple imaging sessions using advanced multiband acquisition sequences, providing benchmark data for reproducibility across scan types and temporal resolutions.

Prior to the launch of the NKI–Rockland Sample, this test–retest dataset was obtained to assess the **reliability of multiband resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI)** and **DTI** measures.  
Most participants were drawn from the initial NKI–RS cohort, for whom detailed psychiatric assessments are available. Participants were **not excluded based on history of mental illness**, allowing inclusion of a broader range of brain-behavior variability.

This resource enables reliability analysis across different repetition times (TR = 645 ms, 1400 ms, and 2500 ms) and comparison between diffusion and functional imaging modalities — an important benchmark for reproducibility studies and methods development in multiband fMRI.

## Scan Parameters

Each participant underwent the following MRI acquisitions:

| Sequence | Description | TR | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----|-------|
| R-mfMRI | Resting-state multiband fMRI | 645 ms | High temporal resolution |
| R-mfMRI | Resting-state multiband fMRI | 1400 ms | Moderate temporal resolution |
| R-fMRI | Conventional resting-state fMRI | 2500 ms | Standard acquisition |
| DTI | Diffusion Tensor Imaging | 137 directions | Full brain coverage |

Participants were scanned in repeated sessions to measure **test–retest reliability** across imaging modalities and acquisition protocols.
