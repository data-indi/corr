# Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)

The **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)** was created to provide an open-science resource for **test–retest reliability** and **reproducibility** studies in functional and structural connectomics.

This repository collects and documents CoRR test–retest datasets that have been mirrored and/or processed by the **Pittsburgh Fiber Data Hub**, with helper files to simplify downstream analysis.

> Upstream data are shared via the **International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI)** and the **1000 Functional Connectomes Project**.

---

## Goals of CoRR

CoRR was established to:

1. **Establish test–retest reliability and reproducibility** for commonly used MR-based connectome metrics.
2. **Characterize variability across sites and designs**, including differences in reliability across imaging centers, scanners, and retest intervals.
3. **Provide benchmark datasets** for evaluating new metrics, preprocessing pipelines, and analysis methods.

Because CoRR is primarily a **retrospective aggregation**, its **phenotypic key** emphasizes variables that are:

* **Core:** minimal variables necessary to characterize any dataset (e.g., age, sex)
* **Preferred:** recommended variables that are important and likely to be collected across sites
* **Optional:** dataset-specific variables contributed by a subset of sites (e.g., task performance, specialized scales)

---

## What this repository provides

For each CoRR dataset mirrored under `data-indi/corr`, this repository aims to provide:

* **Short dataset summaries** (site, design, sample size, modalities, DOI)
* **Pointers to upstream downloads** (NITRC / INDI project pages)
* **Helper artifacts** when available, such as:

  * `participants.tsv`
  * `qc.tsv`
  * Tractography-ready files (`*.gqi.fz`, `*.qsdr.fz`, `*.sz`, `*.dti.dz`, `*.gqi.dz`)

All raw imaging data remain hosted by **INDI / NITRC** and are subject to the **INDI / CoRR Data Use Agreement**.
