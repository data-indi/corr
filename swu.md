### **License and Data Privacy**

This dataset is part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)** initiative, which promotes open data sharing to advance the study of brain function and connectivity.

> *The CoRR Project data sharing effort provides the research community with open access to datasets contributed by labs from around the world. All datasets in the CoRR repository are entirely anonymized in compliance with HIPAA protocols. This includes the removal of personal identifiers from headers and support files, as well as defacing of structural images. Each participant is assigned a randomized seven-digit ID. Upon receipt by CoRR staff, headers are further processed to ensure no identifying information remains. All phenotypic data are reviewed to remove personally identifying variables. For clinical datasets, categorical diagnoses and severity measures (if available) are provided, along with any physiological data that does not compromise privacy. Datasets are included in the repository only after written permission is granted by contributing investigators, allowing unrestricted public use without limitations.*

### **Sample Overview**

This dataset consists of **20 participants**, each of whom underwent:

* An anatomical scan
* Two resting-state fMRI scans

These scans were part of an experiment on **attentional blink training**. The first resting-state scan was acquired **before** the behavioral pretest and training. The second scan followed training and was acquired **before** the behavioral posttest, which took place outside the scanner.
