# **Southwest Universit (SWU) Training Effects for Attention Blink Task**
This dataset was collected at **Southwest University (Beibei, Chongqing, China)** as part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)** within the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. It includes anatomical and resting-state fMRI data from 20 participants scanned before and after behavioral training on the *attention blink* task, providing a unique opportunity to study how cognitive training influences resting-state functional connectivity.

The **attentional blink** is a well-established paradigm in cognitive neuroscience that examines how rapidly presented stimuli compete for attentional resources over time. This dataset was designed to evaluate the **neural effects of attentional training** and the **test–retest reliability** of resting-state fMRI.

Each of the 20 participants underwent:
1. **Structural MRI** (T1-weighted anatomical scan)  
2. **Resting-state fMRI – Session 1 (Pre-training):** performed before behavioral pretest and attentional training  
3. **Resting-state fMRI – Session 2 (Post-training):** performed after training and behavioral posttest  

During resting-state scans, participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed, remain relaxed, and minimize head movement.  
This design enables investigation of **functional plasticity**, **training-induced changes**, and **reproducibility** of resting-state networks in a controlled longitudinal setup.
