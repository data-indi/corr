# **Hangzhou Normal University (HNU) – One-Month Test–Retest Reliability and Dynamical Resting-State Study**
This dataset was collected at the **Center for Cognition and Brain Disorders, Hangzhou Normal University**, as part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)**. It provides one of the most comprehensive short-term test–retest MRI resources available, featuring multimodal imaging data from 30 healthy adults scanned repeatedly over a one-month period. Each participant underwent ten imaging sessions spaced three days apart, enabling analysis of both **temporal stability** and **dynamic fluctuations** in resting-state brain activity.

Five imaging modalities were acquired at each session — **EPI**, **ASL**, **T1-weighted**, **DTI**, and **T2-weighted** MRI. During functional scans, participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, fixate on a cross, relax, and minimize motion while avoiding intentional cognitive activity such as breath counting or meditation.  
This dataset serves as a benchmark for studying **intra-subject variability**, **test–retest reliability**, and **dynamic functional connectivity** over time.
