# **Xuanwu Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences (XHCUMS) – 6-Month Test–Retest Dataset**
This dataset, collected at **Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China)**, is part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)** within the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. It includes longitudinal MRI data from 24 healthy adults who served as the control group in a stroke recovery study. Each participant was scanned five times at six-month intervals, providing high-quality test–retest data for structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI analyses.

This dataset was designed to evaluate the **reliability of MRI measures over time** in a cohort of healthy adults.  
Each participant underwent **five scanning sessions** spaced six months apart. The consistent acquisition and longitudinal design make the dataset ideal for assessing reproducibility in morphometry, functional connectivity, and diffusion metrics.

During resting-state fMRI, subjects viewed a blank screen and were instructed to **keep their eyes closed**, **relax**, and **minimize movement**.

## Scan Parameters

Each session contains:
- **Anatomical (T1):** high-resolution structural images  
- **Resting-state fMRI (EPI):** intrinsic functional connectivity  
- **Diffusion MRI (DTI):** 3D diffusion-weighted acquisition for white-matter mapping  

Full acquisition parameters are available in the original CoRR documentation.
