# **Beijing Normal University (BNU) – Connectivity-Based Brain Imaging Research Database (C-BIRD)**
This dataset was collected at **Beijing Normal University (BNU)** as part of the **Connectivity-based Brain Imaging Research Database (C-BIRD)** and contributed to the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)**. It includes multimodal MRI data from 57 healthy young adults who completed two scan sessions approximately six weeks apart, designed to assess **test–retest reliability** and **temporal stability** of functional and structural brain connectivity.

Each participant (aged 19–30 years; 30 males, 27 females) was right-handed and reported no neurological or psychiatric disorders.  
The **first session** included two resting-state fMRI scans (separated by about 20 minutes), a T1-weighted anatomical scan, a T2-weighted structural scan, and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan.  
The **second session**, acquired about six weeks later, included resting-state fMRI, T1-weighted, and DTI scans.  
During each resting scan, participants were instructed to rest quietly with eyes closed, remain still, relax, and avoid falling asleep.  

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the **State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning** at Beijing Normal University.
