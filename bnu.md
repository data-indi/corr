**License and Data Privacy**

This dataset is part of the **Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR)** initiative, which promotes open data sharing to advance the study of brain function and connectivity.

> *The CoRR Project data sharing effort provides the research community with open access to datasets contributed by labs from around the world. All datasets in the CoRR repository are entirely anonymized in compliance with HIPAA protocols. This includes the removal of personal identifiers from headers and support files, as well as defacing of structural images. Each participant is assigned a randomized seven-digit ID. Upon receipt by CoRR staff, headers are further processed to ensure no identifying information remains. All phenotypic data are reviewed to remove personally identifying variables. For clinical datasets, categorical diagnoses and severity measures (if available) are provided, along with any physiological data that does not compromise privacy. Datasets are included in the repository only after written permission is granted by contributing investigators, allowing unrestricted public use without limitations.*

### **Sample Overview**

This dataset includes data from **57 healthy, right-handed young adults** (30 males, 27 females; aged 19–30), collected as part of the C-BIRD project at BNU. Each participant completed **two MRI sessions** approximately six weeks apart (mean interval: 40.94 ± 4.51 days). All had no history of neurological or psychiatric illness.

**Scan Protocol:**

* **Session 1:**

  * Two resting-state fMRI scans (\~20 minutes apart)
  * T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and DTI scans

* **Session 2:**

  * Resting-state fMRI, T1-weighted, and DTI scans

Participants were instructed to rest with eyes closed and avoid falling asleep.

Written informed consent was obtained, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at BNU.
